----ML--- google

basis of ml is the process of training a piece of software called a model to make useful predictions and content

Types of ml systems 
1> Supervised Learning
2> Unsupervised learning 
3> Reinforcement learning
4> Generative AI


>>Supervised learning
--
Supervised learning will predict the answer after seeing a lot of data
Common use cases of Supervised learning are 

Regression and Classification

>>Regression:
regression model predicts numeric value 

it consists of input data and respective outputs



Classification:

classification model are used to predict the class of an input 
this is used it find difference between spams and emails

classification models are divided into two types binary and multiclass

Binary:
binary model is used to find difference between two classes or states like rain or no rain


Multiclass: 

Multiclass models are used when there are multiple output cases like rain, hail, snow etc




>> Unsupervised learning

in Unsupervised learning the model makes predictions on data that doesn't have correct answers, here the goal of model is to identify meaningful patterns on which the data will be classified.

A commonly used unsupervised learning model employs a technique called clustering



>> Reinforcement learning 

reinforcement learning model make predictions on the basis of user feedback like rewards and penalties based action performed within an environment 


>> Generative AI

gen AI is the class of models that create content from user input 

gen AI uses a unsupervised approach for training data, model learns to mimic the data its trained from
