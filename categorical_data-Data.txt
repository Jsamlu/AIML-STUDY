------- Categorical Data -----------


Categorical data has specific set of possible values. (usually data that defines groups)

examples: 
	> different species of animals
	> weather or not an email is spam 

## numerical / numbers can also be a Categorical Data 
## True numerical data can be meaningfully multiplied  
## a good example of this is postal code


Encoding : is the process of converting the categorical data or other data into numerical vectors that model can understand.


>> Vocabulary


Dimension is synonym for number of elements in feature vector

meaning the output can be between binary data or in multiple class like data


>> if the feature of data have low number of possible categories, it is useful to encode it in to a vocabulary, the models treats each category as separate feature.

example:  colours in rainbow where each colour is given am integer value for models understanding, so that the model can understand the relations between values.

 

>> ONE-HOT ENCODING

One-hot encoding is a way of representing categorical data as a vector in which:

> one element is set to '1' and all the other element is set to '0'

it is commonly used to represent strings or identifiers that have finite set of possible values.



Country	Vector
"Denmark"	1	0	0	0	0
"Sweden"	0	1	0	0	0
"Norway"	0	0	1	0	0
"Finland"	0	0	0	1	0
"Iceland"	0	0	0	0	1


one-hot encoding is an alternative to representing data numerical data 
where using numerical data is not making sense like giving 0, 1, 2, 3 indexes to countries names

> in one-hot encoding each category will be represented as a vector of n elements
> exactly one element in one-hot vectors will have value 1.0 and the remaining will have 0.0

>>multi-one-hot vector is also in existence where element can be in multiple category do the vector will have multiples values 1.0
