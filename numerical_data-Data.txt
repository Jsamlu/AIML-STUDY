Data 

types of data for ml

1> Numerical Data
2> Categorical Data


Numerical Data usually numbers and integers that can be added or multiplied and can performed mathematical operations on
they can be counted or ordered and many things


how model actually ingest data as vectors?

the model ingests a feature vector (a Floating Point vector)

feature vector - same as it sounds an floating point vector(1D array) of required Features 
feature Engineering - the process of determining the best way to represent raw data as the trainable vectors 


feature engineering includes 
	Normalization  : converting numerical values into standard range
	Binning (Bucketing) : converting numerical values into buckets of range(converting simple feature into multiple range of binary features called buckets or bins)



Visualize your data
	graphs or histograms

Statistically evaluate your data 
	calculate mean, std, and the Quartile of data at 0th, 25th, 50th, and 100th


Find outliers
	outliers are the values that are far distant form the usual values of features and label, they often cause problems
	if the outlier is not useful remove it, if it have an outlier label in case it is useful use methods like CLIPPING
